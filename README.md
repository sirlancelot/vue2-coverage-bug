# Vue 2 + Typescript + Vite + Vitest

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 2 and Typescript

## Coverage Bug

There seems to be a bug when calculating coverage for `.vue` files. Run the npm
command `npm run test:coverage`, open `coverage/index.html` in a browser and
navigate to `src/App.vue` to see that each line has "1x" next to it.
